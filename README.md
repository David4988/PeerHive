- ✅ `EmotionalDamageBoard.jsx` — Admin dashboard auto-updates with 🔴 critical moodScore entries (`< -0.7`).
- ✅ Dark Mode Toggle 🌙 — No libs, no context, just raw `classList.toggle()`.
- ✅ Responsive Header — Built from scratch, with **GSAP-powered 🍔 dropdown animation**.
- ✅ Fully modular folder structure: `components/home`, `backend`, etc.
- ✅ Firebase image uploads integrated into mood logs (Week 2 sprint 🔥).
